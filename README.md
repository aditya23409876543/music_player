## 📖 Overview

**Harmony** is a full-stack application designed to demonstrate the power of integrating simple backend logic with modern frontend aesthetics. 

*   **Backend:** Written in **Java**, leveraging `LinkedList` data structures for efficient playlist management. It processes song metadata and exports a dynamic playlist.
*   **Frontend:** Built with **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**, offering a responsive, glassmorphism-inspired interface with real-time audio visualization and controls.
*   **Integration:** A seamless JSON-based data pipeline functionality connects the two layers.

*   **Path Encoding:** robust handling of file paths and URL encoding for web compatibility.
*   **Clean Code:** Minimalist, beginner-friendly implementation (<100 lines).

### 🎨 Web Frontend
